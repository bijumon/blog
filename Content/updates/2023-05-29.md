# Draft #

[Development notes from xkcd's Gravity and Escape Speed](https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-gravity-escape-speed/) #gamedev

> Escape Seed is a large space exploration game created and drawn by Randall Munroe. 
> 
> This was one of the most ambitious — and most delayed — April Fools comics we’ve ever shipped. The art, physics, story, game logic, and render performance all needed to work together to pull this off. We decided to take the time to get it right.
>
> The game is a spiritual successor to last year’s [Gravity](https://xkcd.com/2712) space exploration comic. Our goal was to deepen the game with a bigger map and more orbital mechanics challenges to play with.
