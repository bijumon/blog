I've been playing [WOS - Words On Stream](https://wos.gg/en/) on the twitch app. I suck at it because my vocabulary is pathetic. 

How to improve my vocabulary and get better at this game? 

A good place to start would be [Wiktionary:Extended Basic English alphabetical wordlist - Simple English Wiktionary](https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Extended_Basic_English_alphabetical_wordlist).

I need to keep notes on my reading and write summaries. see [Writing summaries is more important than reading more books](https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries)
